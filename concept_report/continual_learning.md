"Continual learning, sometimes referred to as lifelong learning or incremental learning, is a subfield of machine
learning that focuses on the challenging problem of incrementally training models on a stream of data with
the aim of accumulating knowledge over time"

"learn new skills with minimal forgetting of what they had learned previously"

"When trained on a stream of data whose underlying distribution changes
over time, deep learning models tend to adapt to the most recent data, thereby “catastrophically” forgetting
the information that had been learned earlier"
